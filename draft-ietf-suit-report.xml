    <abstract>


<t>The Software Update for the Internet of Things (SUIT) manifest provides
a way for many different update and boot
workflows to be described by a common format. However, this does not
provide a feedback mechanism for developers in the event that an update
or boot fails.</t>

<t>This specification describes a lightweight feedback mechanism that
allows a developer in possession of a manifest to reconstruct the
decisions made and actions performed by a manifest processor.</t>

<section anchor="introduction"><name>Introduction</name>

<t>A SUIT manifest processor can fail to install or boot an update for many
reasons. Frequently, the error codes generated by such systems fail to
provide developers with enough information to find root causes and
produce corrective actions, resulting in extra effort to reproduce
failures. Logging the results of each SUIT command can simplify this
process.</t>

<t>While it is possible to report the results of SUIT commands through
existing logging or attestation mechanisms, this comes with several
drawbacks:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>data inflation, particularly when designed for text-based logging</t>
  <t>missing information elements</t>
  <t>missing support for multiple components</t>
</list></t>

<t>The CBOR objects defined in this document allow devices to:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>report a trace of how an update was performed</t>
  <t>report expected vs. actual values for critical checks</t>
  <t>describe the installation of complex multi-component architectures</t>
  <t>describe the measured properties of a system</t>
  <t>report the exact reason for a parsing failure</t>
</list></t>

<t>This document provides a definition of a SUIT-specific logging container
that may be used in a variety of scenarios.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="terminology"><name>Conventions and Terminology</name>

<t>The key words "<bcp14>MUST</bcp14>", "<bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14>", "<bcp14>REQUIRED</bcp14>", "<bcp14>SHALL</bcp14>", "<bcp14>SHALL</bcp14>
NOT", "<bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14>", "<bcp14>SHOULD NOT</bcp14>", "<bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14>", "<bcp14>NOT RECOMMENDED</bcp14>",
"<bcp14>MAY</bcp14>", and "<bcp14>OPTIONAL</bcp14>" in this document are to be interpreted as
described in BCP 14 <xref target="RFC2119"/> <xref target="RFC8174"/> when, and only when, they
appear in all capitals, as shown here.</t>

<t>Terms used in this specification include:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Boot: initialization of an executable image. Although this
specification refers to boot, any boot-specific operations described
are equally applicable to starting an executable in an OS context.</t>
</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="the-suit-record"><name>The SUIT Record</name>

<t>If the developer can be assumed to have a copy of the
manifest, then they need little information to reconstruct what the
manifest processor has done. They simply need any data that influences
the control flow of the manifest. The manifest only supports the
following control flow primitives:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Set Component</t>
  <t>Set/Override Parameters</t>
  <t>Try-Each</t>
  <t>Run Sequence</t>
  <t>Conditions</t>
</list></t>

<t>Of these, only conditions change the behavior of the processor from the
default, and then only when the condition fails.</t>

<t>Then, to reconstruct the flow of a manifest, all a developer needs is
a list of metadata about failed conditions:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>the current manifest</t>
  <t>the current section</t>
  <t>the offset into the current section</t>
  <t>the current component index</t>
  <t>the "reason" for failure</t>
</list></t>

<t>Most conditions compare a parameter to an actual value, so the "reason"
is typically simply the actual value.</t>

<t>Since it is possible that a non-condition command (directive) may fail in an
exceptional circumstance, this must be included as well. However, 
a failed directive will terminate processing of the manifest. To accommodate
for a failed command and for explicit "completion," an additional "result"
element is added as well. In the case of a command failure,
the failure reason is typically a numeric error code. However, these error
codes need to be standardised in order to be useful.</t>

<t>Reconstructing what a device has done in this way is compact,
however it requires some reconstruction effort. This is an issue that
can be solved by tooling.</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
SUIT_Record = [
    suit-record-manifest-id        : [* uint ],
    suit-record-manifest-section   : int,
    suit-record-section-offset     : uint,
    suit-record-component-index    : uint,
    suit-record-properties         : SUIT_Parameters,
    $$SUIT_Record_Extensions
]
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>suit-record-manifest-id is used to identify which manifest contains the
command that caused the record to be generated. The manifest id is a
list of integers that form a walk of the manifest tree, starting at the
root. An empty list indicates that the command was contained in the
root manifest. If the list is not empty, the command was contained in
one of the root manifest's dependencies, or nested even further below
that.</t>

<t>For example, suppose that the root manifest has 3 dependencies
and each of those dependencies has 2 dependencies of its own:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Root  <list style="symbols">
      <t>Dependency A      <list style="symbols">
          <t>Dependency A0</t>
          <t>Dependency A1</t>
        </list></t>
      <t>Dependency B      <list style="symbols">
          <t>Dependency B0</t>
          <t>Dependency B1</t>
        </list></t>
      <t>Dependency C      <list style="symbols">
          <t>Dependency C0</t>
          <t>Dependency C1</t>
        </list></t>
    </list></t>
</list></t>

<t>A manifest-id of [1,0] would indicate that the current command was
contained within Dependency B0. Similarly, a manifest-id of [2,1]
would indicate Dependency C1</t>

<t>suit-record-manifest-section indicates which section of the manifest was
active. This is used in addition to an offset so that the developer can
index into severable sections in a predictable way. The value of this
element is the value of the key that identified the section in the
manifest.</t>

<t>suit-record-section-offset is the number of bytes into the current
section at which the current command is located.</t>

<t>suit-record-component-index is the index of the component that was
specified at the time that the report was generated. This field is
necessary due to the availability of set-current-component values of
True and a list of components. Both of these values cause the manifest
processor to loop over commands using a series of component-ids, so the
developer needs to know which was selected when the command executed.</t>

<t>suit-record-properties contains any measured properties that led to the
command failure.
For example, this could be the actual value of a SUIT_Digest or
class identifier. This is encoded in a SUIT_Parameters block as defined
in <xref target="I-D.ietf-suit-manifest"/>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="the-suit-report"><name>The SUIT Report</name>

<t>Some metadata is common to all records, such as the root manifest:
the manifest that is the entry-point for the manifest processor. This
metadata is aggregated with a list of SUIT_Records. The SUIT_Report
may also contain a list of any system properties that were measured
and reported, and a reason for a failure if one occured.</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
SUIT_Report = {
  suit-report-manifest-digest => SUIT_Digest,
  ? suit-report-manifest-uri  => tstr,
  ? suit-report-nonce         => bstr,
  suit-report-records         => [ * SUIT_Record / system-property-claims ],
  suit-report-result          => true / {
    suit-report-result-code   => int, ; could condense to enum later
    suit-report-result-record => SUIT_Record,
  }
  $$SUIT_Report_Extensions
}
system-property-claims = {
  system-component-id => SUIT_Component_Identifier,
  + SUIT_Parameters,
}
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>suit-report-manifest-digest provides a SUIT_Digest (as defined in
<xref target="I-D.ietf-suit-manifest"/>) that is the characteristic digest of the
Root manifest.</t>

<t>suit-report-manifest-uri provides the reference URI that was provided in
the root manifest.</t>

<t>suit-report-nonce provides a container for freshness or replay
protection information. This field <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be omitted where the suit-report
is authenticated within a container that provides freshness already.
For example, attestation evidence typically contains a proof of
freshness.</t>

<t>suit-report-records is a list of 0 or more SUIT Records or 
system-property-claims. Because SUIT Records are only generated on failure,
in simple cases this can be an empty list. SUIT_Records and 
suit-system-property-claims are merged into a single list because this
reduces the overhead for a constrained node that generates this report.
The use of a single append-only log allows report generators to use simple
memory management. Because the system-property-claims are encoded as maps
and SUIT_Records are encoded as lists, a recipient need only filter the
CBOR Type-5 entries from suit-report-records to obtain all 
system-property-claims.</t>

<t>System properties can be extracted from suit-report-records by filtering
suit-report-records for maps. System Properties are a list of measured 
or asserted properties
of the system that creates the suit report. These properties are scoped by
component identifier. Because this list is expected to be constructed on
the fly by a constrained node, component identifiers may appear more than
once. A recipient may convert the result to a more conventional structure:</t>

<figure><sourcecode type="CDDL"><![CDATA[
SUIT_Record_System_Properties = {
  * component-id => {
    + SUIT_Parameters,
  }
}
]]></sourcecode></figure>

<t>suit-report-result provides a mechanism to show that the SUIT procedure
completed successfully (value is true) or why it failed (value is a map
of an error code and a SUIT_Record).</t>

<t>The suit-report-result-code indicates the reason for the failure. Values
are expected to be CBOR parsing failures, Schema validation failures,
COSE validation failures or SUIT processing failures.</t>

<t>The suit-report-result-record indicates the exact point in the manifest
or manifest dependency tree where the error occured.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="attestation"><name>Attestation</name>

<t>This document describes how a well-informed verifier can infer the trustworthiness of a remote device. Remote attestation is done by using the SUIT_Manifest_Envelope along with the SUIT_Report to reconstruct the state of the device at boot time. By embedding data used for remote attestation in the SUIT_Report, a remote device can use an append-only log to collect both measurements and debug/failure information into the same document. This document can then be conveyed to a verifier as a part of the attestation evidence. A remote attestation format to convey attestation evidence, such as an Entity Attestation Token (EAT, see <xref target="I-D.ietf-rats-eat"/>), that contains a SUIT_Report <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> also include an integrity measurement of the Manifest Processor &amp; Report Generator.</t>

<t>When a Concise Reference Integrity Manifest (CoRIM, see <xref target="I-D.birkholz-rats-corim"/> is delivered in a SUIT_Manifest_Envelope, this codifies the delivery of verification information to the verifier:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>The Firmware Distributor:
  <list style="symbols">
      <t>sends the SUIT_Manifest_Envelope to the Verifier without payload or text, but with CoRIM</t>
      <t>sends the SUIT_Manifest_Envelope to the recipient without CoRIM, or text, but with payload</t>
    </list></t>
  <t>The Recipient:
  <list style="symbols">
      <t>Installs the firmware as described in the SUIT_Manifest and generates a SUIT_report, which is encapsulated in an EAT by the installer and sent to the Firmware Distributor.</t>
      <t>Boots the firmware as described in the SUIT_Manifest and creates a SUIT_report, which is encapsulated in an EAT by the installer and sent to the Firmware Distributor.</t>
    </list></t>
  <t>The Firmware Distributor sends both reports to the verifier (separately or together)</t>
  <t>The Verifier:
  <list style="symbols">
      <t>Reconstructs the state of the device using the manifest</t>
      <t>Compares this state to the CoRIM</t>
      <t>Returns an Attestation Report to the Firmware Distributor</t>
    </list></t>
</list></t>

<t>This approach simplifies the design of the bootloader since it is able to use an append-only log. It allows a verifier to validate this report against a signed CoRIM that is provided by the firmware author, which simplifies the delivery chain of verification information to the verifier.</t>

<t>This information is not intended as Attestation Evidence and while an Attestation Report <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> provide this information for conveying error codes and/or failure reports, it <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be translated into general-purpose claims for use by the Relying Party.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="capability-reporting"><name>Capability Reporting</name>

<t>Because SUIT is extensible, a manifest author must know what capabilities a device has available. To enable this, a capability report is a set of lists that define which commands, parameters, algorithms, and component IDs are supported by a manifest processor.</t>

<t>The CDDL for a SUIT_Capability_Report follows:</t>

<figure><sourcecode type="CDDL"><![CDATA[
SUIT_Capability_Report = {
  suit-component-capabilities        => [+ SUIT_Component_Capability ]
  suit-command-capabilities          => [+ int],
  suit-parameters-capabilities       => [+ int],
  suit-crypt-algo-capabilities       => [+ int],
  ? suit-envelope-capabilities       => [+ int],
  ? suit-manifest-capabilities       => [+ int],
  ? suit-common-capabilities         => [+ int],
  ? suit-text-component-capabilities => [+ int],
  ? suit-text-capabilities           => [+ int],
  ? suit-dependency-capabilities     => [+ int],
  * [+int]                           => [+ int],
  $$SUIT_Capability_Report_Extensions
}

SUIT_Component_Capability = [*bstr,?true]
]]></sourcecode></figure>

<t>A SUIT_Component_Capability is similar to a SUIT_Component_ID, with one difference: it may optionally be terminated by a CBOR 'true' which acts as a wild-card match for any component with a prefix matching the SUIT_Component_Capability leading up to the 'true.' This feature is for use with filesystem storage, key value stores, or any other arbitrary-component-id storage systems.</t>

<t>When reporting capabilities, it is <bcp14>OPTIONAL</bcp14> to report capabilities that are declared mandatory by the SUIT Manifest <xref target="I-D.ietf-suit-manifest"/>. Capabilities defined by extensions <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be reported.</t>

<t>Additional capability reporting can be added as follows: if a manifest element does not exist in this map, it can be added by specifying the CBOR path to the manifest element in an array and using this as the key. For example SUIT_Dependencies, as described in <xref target="I-D.ietf-suit-trust-domains"/> could have an extension added, which was key 3 in the SUIT_Dependencies map. This capability would be reported as: [3, 3, 1] =&gt; [3], where the key consists of the key for SUIT_Manifest (3), the key for SUIT_Common (3), and the key for SUIT_Dependencies (1). Then the value indicates that this manifest processor supports the extension (3).</t>

</section>
<section anchor="iana"><name>IANA Considerations</name>

<t>IANA is requested to allocate a CBOR tag for the SUIT Report.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="security-considerations"><name>Security Considerations</name>

<t>The SUIT Report should either be carried over a secure transport, or
signed, or both. Ideally, attestation should be used to prove that the
report was generated by legitimate hardware.</t>

	 <t>   This specification describes the format of a manifest.  A manifest is
   a bundle of metadata about code/data obtained by a recipient (chiefly
   the firmware for an IoT device), where to find the that code/data,
   the devices to which it applies, and cryptographic information
   protecting the manifest.  Software updates and Trusted Invocation
   both tend to use sequences of common operations, so the manifest
   encodes those sequences of operations, rather than declaring the
   metadata.

	 <t>   Remote Attestation Procedures (RATS) enable Relying Parties to assess
   the trustworthiness of a remote Attester and therefore to decide
   whether to engage in secure interactions with it.  Evidence about
   trustworthiness can be rather complex and it is deemed unrealistic
   that every Relying Party is capable of the appraisal of Evidence.
   Therefore that burden is typically offloaded to a Verifier.  In order
   to conduct Evidence appraisal, a Verifier requires not only fresh
   Evidence from an Attester, but also trusted Endorsements and
   Reference Values from Endorsers and Reference Value Providers, such
   as manufacturers, distributors, or device owners.  This document
   specifies Concise Reference Integrity Manifests (CoRIM) that
   represent Endorsements and Reference Values in CBOR format.
   Composite devices or systems are represented by a collection of
   Concise Module Identifiers (CoMID) and Concise Software Identifiers
   (CoSWID) bundled in a CoRIM document.
