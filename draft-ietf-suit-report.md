--- abstract

The Software Update for the Internet of Things (SUIT) manifest provides
a way for many different update and boot
workflows to be described by a common format.
This specification describes a lightweight feedback mechanism that
allows a developer in possession of a manifest to reconstruct the
decisions made and actions performed by a manifest processor.

--- middle

# Introduction

This specification describes a SUIT-specific
logging container that creates a lightweight feedback mechanism for
developers in the event that an update or boot fails in the manifest
processor.

A SUIT manifest processor can fail to install or boot an update for many
reasons. Frequently, the error codes generated by such systems fail to
provide developers with enough information to find root causes and
produce corrective actions, resulting in extra effort to reproduce
failures. Logging the results of each SUIT command can simplify this
process.

While it is possible to report the results of SUIT commands through
existing logging or attestation mechanisms, this comes with several
drawbacks:

* data inflation, particularly when designed for text-based logging
* missing information elements
* missing support for multiple components

The CBOR objects defined in this document allow devices to:

* report a trace of how an update was performed
* report expected vs. actual values for critical checks
* describe the installation of complex multi-component architectures
* describe the measured properties of a system
* report the exact reason for a parsing failure

#  Conventions and Terminology {#terminology}

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

Terms used in this specification include:

* Boot: initialization of an executable image. Although this
  specification refers to boot, any boot-specific operations described
  are equally applicable to starting an executable in an OS context.

# The SUIT\_Record

If the developer has a copy of the
manifest, then they need little information to reconstruct what the
manifest processor has done. They simply need any data that influences
the control flow of the manifest. The manifest only supports the
following control flow primitives:

- Set Component
- Set/Override Parameters
- Try-Each
- Run Sequence
- Conditions

Of these, only conditions change the behavior of the processor from the
default, and then only when the condition fails.

To reconstruct the flow of a manifest, a developer needs
a list of metadata about failed conditions:

- the current manifest
- the current section
- the offset into the current section
- the current component index
- the "reason" for failure

Most conditions compare a parameter to an actual value, so the "reason"
is typically the actual value.

Since it is possible that a non-condition command (directive) may fail in an
exceptional circumstance,
a failure code for a non condition command must be included as well. However,
a failed directive will terminate processing of the manifest. To accommodate
for a failed command and for explicit "completion," an additional "result"
element is included as well, however this is included in the SUIT\_Report, see {{suit-report}}.
In the case of a command failure,
the failure reason is typically a numeric error code. However, these error
codes need to be standardised in order to be useful.

Reconstructing what a device has done in this way is compact,
however it requires some reconstruction effort. This is an issue that
can be solved by tooling.

~~~CDDL
SUIT_Record = [
    suit-record-manifest-id        : [* uint ],
    suit-record-manifest-section   : int,
    suit-record-section-offset     : uint,
    suit-record-component-index    : uint,
    suit-record-properties         : SUIT_Parameters,
    $$SUIT_Record_Extensions
]
~~~

suit-record-manifest-id is used to identify which manifest contains the
command that caused the record to be generated. The manifest id is a
list of integers that form a walk of the manifest tree, starting at the
root. An empty list indicates that the command was contained in the
root manifest. If the list is not empty, the command was contained in
one of the root manifest's dependencies, or nested even further below
that.

For example, suppose that the root manifest has 3 dependencies
and each of those dependencies has 2 dependencies of its own:

* Root

    * Dependency A (index 0)

        * Dependency AA (index 0,0)
        * Dependency AB (index 0,1)

    * Dependency B (index 1)

        * Dependency BA (index 1,0)
        * Dependency BB (index 1,1)

    * Dependency C (index 2)

        * Dependency CA (index 2,0)
        * Dependency CB (index 2,1)

A manifest-id of \[1,0\] would indicate that the current command was
contained within Dependency BA. Similarly, a manifest-id of \[2,1\]
would indicate Dependency CB

suit-record-manifest-section indicates which section of the manifest was
active. This is used in addition to an offset so that the developer can
index into severable sections in a predictable way. The value of this
element is the value of the key that identified the section in the
manifest.

suit-record-section-offset is the number of bytes into the current
section at which the current command is located.

suit-record-component-index is the index of the component that was
specified at the time that the report was generated. This field is
necessary due to the availability of set-current-component values of
True and a list of components. Both of these values cause the manifest
processor to loop over commands using a series of component-ids, so the
developer needs to know which was selected when the command executed.

suit-record-properties contains any measured properties that led to the
command failure.
For example, this could be the actual value of a SUIT\_Digest or
class identifier. This is encoded in a SUIT\_Parameters block as defined
in {{I-D.ietf-suit-manifest}}.

# The SUIT\_Report {#suit-report}

Some metadata is common to all records, such as the root manifest:
the manifest that is the entry-point for the manifest processor. This
metadata is aggregated with a list of SUIT\_Records. The SUIT\_Report
may also contain a list of any system properties that were measured
and reported, and a reason for a failure if one occurred.

~~~CDDL
SUIT_Report = {
  suit-reference              => SUIT_Reference,
  ? suit-report-nonce         => bstr,
  suit-report-records         => \
        \[ * SUIT_Record / system-property-claims \],
  suit-report-result          => true / {
    suit-report-result-code   => int,
    suit-report-result-record => SUIT_Record,
    suit-report-result-reason => SUIT_Report_Reasons,
  },
  ? suit-report-capability-report => SUIT_Capability_Report,
  $$SUIT_Report_Extensions
}
system-property-claims = {
  system-component-id => SUIT_Component_Identifier,
  + SUIT_Parameters,
}
~~~

The suit-reference provides a reference URI and digest for a suit
manifest. The URI MUST be the canonical URI that is provided in the
manifest. The digest is the digest of the manifest.

NOTE: The digest is used
in preference to other identifiers in the manifest because it allows
a manifest to be uniquely identified (collision resistance) whereas
other identifiers, such as the sequence number, can collide,
particularly in scenarios with multiple trusted signers.

The following CDDL describes a SUIT\_Reference.

~~~CDDL
SUIT_Reference = {
    suit-report-manifest-uri  : tstr,
    suit-report-manifest-digest : SUIT_Digest,
}
~~~

suit-report-manifest-digest provides a SUIT\_Digest (as defined in
{{I-D.ietf-suit-manifest}}) that is the characteristic digest of the
Root manifest.

suit-report-manifest-uri provides the reference URI that was provided in
the root manifest.

suit-report-nonce provides a container for freshness or replay
protection information. This field MAY be omitted where the suit-report
is authenticated within a container that provides freshness already.
For example, attestation evidence typically contains a proof of
freshness.

## SUIT\_Report\_Records {#suit-report-records}

suit-report-records is a list of 0 or more SUIT\_Records or
system-property-claims. Because SUIT\_Records are only generated on failure,
in simple cases this can be an empty list. SUIT\_Records and
suit-system-property-claims are merged into a single list because this
reduces the overhead for a constrained node that generates this report.
The use of a single append-only log allows report generators to use simple
memory management. 
The concept of append-only logs for software supply chains
is explained in {{I-D.ietf-scitt-architecture}}. Because the system-property-claims
are encoded as maps and SUIT\_Records are encoded as lists, a recipient need
only filter the CBOR Type-5 entries from suit-report-records to obtain all 
system-property-claims.

System Properties can be extracted from suit-report-records by filtering
suit-report-records for maps. System Properties are a list of measured
or asserted properties
of the system that creates the SUIT\_Report. These properties are scoped by
component identifier. Because this list is expected to be constructed on
the fly by a constrained node, component identifiers may appear more than
once. A recipient may convert the result to a more conventional structure:

~~~~CDDL
SUIT_Record_System_Properties = {
  * component-id => {
    + SUIT_Parameters,
  }
}
~~~~

## SUIT\_Report Result {#suit-report-result}

suit-report-result provides a mechanism to show that the SUIT procedure
completed successfully (value is true) or why it failed (value is a map
of an error code and a SUIT\_Record).

suit-report-result-reason gives a high-level explanation of the failure.
These reasons are intended for interoperable implementations. The reasons
are divided into a small number of groups:

* suit-report-reason-cbor-parse: a parsing error was encountered by the
CBOR parser.
* suit-report-reason-cose-unsupported: an unusupported COSE structure or
header was encountered.
* suit-report-reason-alg-unsupported: an unsupported COSE algorithm was
encountered.
* suit-report-reason-unauthorised: Signature/MAC verification failed.
* suit-report-reason-command-unsupported: an unsupported command was
encountered.
* suit-report-reason-component-unsupported: The manifest declared a
component/prefix that does not exist.
* suit-report-reason-component-unauthorised: The manifest declared a
component that is not accessible by the signer.
* suit-report-reason-parameter-unsupported: The manifest used a
parameter that does not exist.
* suit-report-severing-unsupported: The manifest uses severable fields
but the Manifest Processor doesn't support them.
* suit-report-reason-condition-failed: A condition failed with soft-
failure off.
* suit-report-reason-operation-failed: A command failed (e.g.,
download/copy/swap/write)

The suit-report-result-code reports an internal error code that is
provided for debugging reasons. This code is not intended for
interoperability.

The suit-report-result-record indicates the exact point in the manifest
or manifest dependency tree where the error occurred.

suit-report-capability-report provides a mechanism to report the capabilities of the Manifest Processor. The SUIT\_Capability\_Report is described in {{capabilities}}. The capability report is optional to include in the SUIT\_Report, according to an application-specific policy. While the SUIT\_Capability\_Report is not expected to be very large, applications should ensure that they only report capabilities when necessary in order to conserve bandwidth. A capability report is not necessary except when:

1. A client explicitly requests the capability report, or
2. A manifest attempts to use a capability that the Manifest Processor does not implement.

#  Attestation

This document describes how a well-informed verifier can infer the trustworthiness of a remote device. Remote attestation is done by using the SUIT\_Manifest\_Envelope along with the SUIT\_Report to reconstruct the state of the device at boot time. By embedding data used for remote attestation in the SUIT\_Report, a remote device can use an append-only log to collect both measurements and debug/failure information into the same document. This document can then be conveyed to a verifier as a part of the attestation evidence. A remote attestation format to convey attestation evidence, such as an Entity Attestation Token (EAT, see {{-EAT}}), that contains a SUIT\_Report MUST also include an integrity measurement of the Manifest Processor & Report Generator.

When a Concise Reference Integrity Manifest (CoRIM, see {{-CoRIM}}) is delivered in a SUIT\_Manifest\_Envelope, this codifies the delivery of verification information to the verifier:

* The Firmware Distributor:
    * sends the SUIT\_Manifest\_Envelope to the Verifier without payload or text, but with CoRIM
    * sends the SUIT\_Manifest\_Envelope to the recipient without CoRIM, or text, but with payload
* The Recipient:
    * Installs the firmware as described in the SUIT\_Manifest and generates a SUIT\_report, which is encapsulated in an EAT by the installer and sent to the Firmware Distributor.
    * Boots the firmware as described in the SUIT\_Manifest and creates a SUIT\_report, which is encapsulated in an EAT by the installer and sent to the Firmware Distributor.
* The Firmware Distributor sends both reports to the verifier (separately or together)
* The Verifier:
    * Reconstructs the state of the device using the manifest
    * Compares this state to the CoRIM
    * Returns an Attestation Report to the Firmware Distributor

This approach simplifies the design of the bootloader since it is able to use an append-only log. It allows a verifier to validate this report against a signed CoRIM that is provided by the firmware author, which simplifies the delivery chain of verification information to the verifier.

This information is not intended as Attestation Evidence and while an Attestation Report MAY provide this information for conveying error codes and/or failure reports, it SHOULD be translated into general-purpose claims for use by the Relying Party.

# Capability Reporting {#capabilities}

Because SUIT is extensible, a manifest author must know what capabilities a device has available. To enable this, a capability report is a set of lists that define which commands, parameters, algorithms, and component IDs are supported by a manifest processor.

The CDDL for a SUIT\_Capability\_Report follows:

~~~~CDDL
SUIT_Capability_Report = {
  suit-component-capabilities  => [+ SUIT_Component_Capability ]
  suit-command-capabilities          => [+ int],
  suit-parameters-capabilities       => [+ int],
  suit-crypt-algo-capabilities       => [+ int],
  ? suit-envelope-capabilities       => [+ int],
  ? suit-manifest-capabilities       => [+ int],
  ? suit-common-capabilities         => [+ int],
  ? suit-text-capabilities           => [+ int],
  ? suit-text-component-capabilities => [+ int],
  ? suit-dependency-capabilities     => [+ int],
  * [+int]                           => [+ int],
  $$SUIT_Capability_Report_Extensions
}

SUIT_Component_Capability = [*bstr,?true]
~~~

A SUIT\_Component\_Capability is similar to a SUIT\_Component\_ID, with one difference: it may optionally be terminated by a CBOR 'true' which acts as a wild-card match for any component with a prefix matching the SUIT\_Component\_Capability leading up to the 'true.' This feature is for use with filesystem storage, key value stores, or any other arbitrary-component-id storage systems.

When reporting capabilities, it is OPTIONAL to report capabilities that are declared mandatory by the SUIT Manifest {{I-D.ietf-suit-manifest}}. Capabilities defined by extensions MUST be reported.

Additional capability reporting can be added as follows: if a manifest element does not exist in this map, it can be added by specifying the CBOR path to the manifest element in an array and using this as the key. For example SUIT\_Dependencies, as described in {{I-D.ietf-suit-trust-domains}} could have an extension added, which was key 3 in the SUIT\_Dependencies map. This capability would be reported as: \[3, 3, 1\] => \[3\], where the key consists of the key for SUIT\_Manifest (3), the key for SUIT\_Common (3), and the key for SUIT\_Dependencies (1). Then the value indicates that this manifest processor supports the extension (3).

#  EAT Claim {#eat}

The SUIT\_Report is a form of measurement done by the SUIT Manifest Processor as it attempts to invoke a manifest or install a manifest. As a result, the SUIT\_Report can be captured in an EAT measurements type.
The Verifier MAY convert a SUIT\_Report into a more consumable version of the EAT claim by, for example, constructing a measurement results claim that contains the digest of a component, the vendor ID & class ID of a component, etc.

#  SUIT\_Report container {#container}

The SUIT\_Report MUST be carried in a container or transport that ensures authenticity. The SUIT\_Report MUST be transported using one of the following options:

* As an element of an existing document that ensures authenticity, such as in a measurements claim in an EAT.
* As the payload of a message delivered over secure transport, such as a CoAP {{?RFC7252}} or Lightweight Machine to Machine {{LwM2M}} message.
* Contained within a secure container that conforms to the current recommendations of {{I-D.ietf-suit-mti}}.

In this case, the SUIT\_Report is carried as sole payload of a COSE\_Encrypt0 or COSE\_Sign1 as shown in the CDDL snippet below.

~~~CDDL
SUIT_Report_Protected /= SUIT_Report_COSE_Sign1 \
                         .and SUIT_COSE_Profiles
SUIT_Report_Protected /= SUIT_Report_COSE_Sign1_Tagged \
                         .and SUIT_COSE_Profiles
SUIT_Report_Protected /= SUIT_Report_COSE_MAC0 \
                         .and SUIT_COSE_Profiles
SUIT_Report_Protected /= SUIT_Report_COSE_MAC0_Tagged \
                         .and SUIT_COSE_Profiles

SUIT_Report_COSE_Sign1_Tagged = #6.18(SUIT_Report_COSE_Sign1)
SUIT_Report_COSE_Sign1 = [
    protected : bstr,
    unprotected : {* int => any},
    payload : bstr .cbor SUIT_Report_Unprotected,
    signature : bstr
]
SUIT_Report_COSE_MAC0_Tagged = #6.17(SUIT_Report_COSE_MAC0)
SUIT_Report_COSE_MAC0 = [
    protected : bstr,
    unprotected : {* int => any},
    payload : bstr .cbor SUIT_Report_Unprotected,
    tag : bstr
]
SUIT_Report_Unprotected = SUIT_Report / SUIT_Report_COSE_Encrypt0
SUIT_Report_COSE_Encrypt0 = COSE_Encrypt0
~~~

Note that SUIT\_Report\_COSE\_Sign1 and SUIT\_Report\_COSE\_MAC0 MUST be combined with a SUIT\_COSE\_Profile from {{I-D.ietf-suit-mti}} using the CDDL .and directive. The SUIT\_Report\_COSE\_Encrypt0 carries a ciphertext payload that MUST contain just the ciphertext obtained by encrypting the following CDDL:

~~~CDDL
SUIT_Report_plaintext = bstr .cbor SUIT_Report
~~~

SUIT\_COSE\_Profiles define only AES-CTR encryption due to its suitability for firmware distribution. Because AES-CTR is not authenticated, SUIT\_Report\_Protected defines authenticated containers with an encrypted payload.

#  IANA Considerations {#iana}

IANA is requested to name the overall SUIT registry group "Software Update for the Internet of Things (SUIT)".

IANA is requested to allocate a CBOR tag for each of:

* SUIT\_Report\_Protected
* SUIT\_Reference
* SUIT\_Capability\_Report

IANA is requested to allocate a CoAP content-type and a media-type for SUIT\_Report.

IANA is also requested to add the following registries to the SUIT registry group:

* SUIT\_Report Elements
* SUIT\_Record Elements
* SUIT\_Report Reasons
* SUIT Capability Report Elements

For each of these registries, registration policy is:

* -256 to 255: Standards Action
* -65536 to 257, 256 to 65535: Specification Required
* -4294967296 to -65537, 65536 to 4294967295: First Come, First Served

## Expert Review Instructions
The IANA registries established in this document allow values to be added based on expert review. This section gives some general guidelines for what the experts should be looking for, but they are being designated as experts for a reason, so they should be given substantial latitude.

Expert reviewers should take into consideration the following points:

* Point squatting should be discouraged. Reviewers are encouraged to get sufficient information for registration requests to ensure that the usage is not going to duplicate one that is already registered, and that the point is likely to be used in deployments. The zones tagged as private use are intended for testing purposes and closed environments; code points in other ranges should not be assigned for testing.
* Specifications are required for the standards track range of point assignment. Specifications should exist for all other ranges, but early assignment before a specification is available is considered to be permissible. When specifications are not provided, the description provided needs to have sufficient information to identify what the point is being used for.
* Experts should take into account the expected usage of fields when approving point assignment. The fact that there is a range for standards track documents does not mean that a standards track document cannot have points assigned outside of that range. The length of the encoded value should be weighed against how many code points of that length are left, the size of device it will be used on, and the number of code points left that encode to that size.

#  Security Considerations

There are two aspects to the security considerations for SUIT\_Reports:
authenticity and confidentiality. SUIT\_Reports must have guaranteed
authenticity for them to be useful. Several options are available to
ensure the authenticity of a SUIT\_Report. The report MAY be bundled
as the payload of a cryptographic container as described in {{container}}.
communicated over a secure transport. It may also be communicated as
part of an existing authenticated protocol, such as within an EAT
token. Ideally, the SUIT\_Report SHOULD be communicated as part of an
attestation flow, such as within an EAT token, since this proves the
authenticity of the environment (hardware, software, or both) in which
the SUIT\_Report was generated.

The SUIT\_Report MAY require confidentiality as well. A SUIT\_Report
could potentially reveal confidential information about the kinds of
device that a particular user has. It could also reveal confidential
information about intellectual property contained in a device. Where
these concerns are relevant, the SUIT\_Report MUST be encrypted, for
example using a COSE\_Encrypt as described in {{container}}, or by using
secure transport. When reporting failures, particularly in the
cryptographic primitives, there is a risk that over-reporting can
provide an attacker with better visibility. Therefore, SUIT\_Reports
SHOULD be encrypted wherever possible.

There are also operational considerations that intersect with these
security considerations. In situations where the SUIT\_Report is
encrypted as an element of a message within another protocol, care must
be taken to ensure that this does not leak information and that the
principle of least privilege is respected. For example, in an EAT-based
attestation workflow, the Verifier often will not need the full SUIT\_Report.
Similarly, the Relying Party may also not need the SUIT\_Report.
To enable the principle of least privilege in this and similar
scenarios, the SUIT\_Report should be independently encrypted even if
the EAT token or encrypted transport that contains it is also encrypted.

In contrast, however, there are scenarios where the EAT Verifier
consumes the SUIT\_Report and translates it into one or more other
EAT claims. For example, a SUIT\_Report that shows a particular digest
was matched using an suit-condition-image can be translated into a
EAT measres (Measurement Results) claim. In this scenario, the Verifier
must have access to the full SUIT\_Report.

# Full CDDL {#full-cddl}
In order to create a valid SUIT\_Report document the structure of the corresponding CBOR message MUST adhere to the following CDDL data definition.

To be valid, the following CDDL MUST have the COSE CDDL appended to it. The COSE CDDL can be obtained by following the directions in {{-cose, Section 1.4}}. It must also have the CDDL from {{I-D.ietf-suit-mti}} appended to it.
