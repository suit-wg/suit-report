--- abstract

The Software Update for the Internet of Things (SUIT) manifest provides
a way for many different update and boot
workflows to be described by a common format.
This specification describes a lightweight feedback mechanism that
allows a developer in possession of a manifest to reconstruct the
decisions made and actions performed by a manifest processor.

--- middle

# Introduction

This specification describes a SUIT-specific
logging container that creates a lightweight feedback mechanism for
developers in the event that an update or boot fails in the manifest
processor.

A SUIT manifest processor can fail to install or boot an update for many
reasons. Frequently, the error codes generated by such systems fail to
provide developers with enough information to find root causes and
produce corrective actions, resulting in extra effort to reproduce
failures. Logging the results of each SUIT command can simplify this
process.

While it is possible to report the results of SUIT commands through
existing logging or attestation mechanisms, this comes with several
drawbacks:

* data inflation, particularly when designed for text-based logging
* missing information elements
* missing support for multiple components

The CBOR objects defined in this document allow devices to:

* report a trace of how an update was performed
* report expected vs. actual values for critical checks
* describe the installation of complex multi-component architectures
* describe the measured properties of a system
* report the exact reason for a parsing failure

#  Conventions and Terminology {#terminology}

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

Terms used in this specification include:

* Boot: initialization of an executable image. Although this
  specification refers to boot, any boot-specific operations described
  are equally applicable to starting an executable in an OS context.

# The SUIT\_Record {#suit-record}

The SUIT\_Record is a record of a decision taken by the Manifest Processor.
It contains the information that the Manifest Processor used to make the
decision. The decision can be inferred from this information, so it is not
includded.
If the developer has a copy of the
manifest, then they need little information to reconstruct what the
manifest processor has done. They need any data that influences
the control flow of the manifest. The manifest only supports the
following control flow primitives:

- Set Component
- Set/Override Parameters
- Try-Each
- Run Sequence
- Conditions

Of these, only conditions change the behavior of the processor from the
default, and then only when the condition fails.

To reconstruct the flow of a manifest, a developer needs
a list of metadata about failed conditions:

- the current manifest
- the current section
- the offset into the current section
- the current component index
- the "reason" for failure

Most conditions compare a parameter to an actual value, so the "reason"
is typically the actual value.

Since it is possible that a non-condition command (directive) may fail in an
exceptional circumstance,
a failure code for a non condition command must be communicated to the developer. However,
a failed directive will terminate processing of the manifest. To accommodate
for a failed command and for explicit "completion," an additional "result"
element is included as well, however this is included in the SUIT\_Report ({{suit-report}}).
In the case of a command failure,
the failure reason is typically a numeric error code. However, these error
codes need to be standardised in order to be useful.

This approach effectively compacts the log of operations taken using the SUIT Manifest
as a dictionary. This enables a full reconstruction of the log using a matching
decompaction tool.

~~~CDDL
SUIT_Record = [
    suit-record-manifest-id        : [* uint ],
    suit-record-manifest-section   : int,
    suit-record-section-offset     : uint,
    suit-record-component-index    : uint,
    suit-record-properties         : SUIT_Parameters,
    $$SUIT_Record_Extensions
]
~~~

suit-record-manifest-id is used to identify which manifest contains the
command that caused the record to be generated. The manifest id is a
list of integers that form a walk of the manifest tree, starting at the
root. An empty list indicates that the command was contained in the
root manifest. If the list is not empty, the command was contained in
one of the root manifest's dependencies, or nested even further below
that.

For example, suppose that the root manifest has 3 dependencies
and each of those dependencies has 2 dependencies of its own:

* Root

    * Dependency A (index 0)

        * Dependency AA (index 0,0)
        * Dependency AB (index 0,1)

    * Dependency B (index 1)

        * Dependency BA (index 1,0)
        * Dependency BB (index 1,1)

    * Dependency C (index 2)

        * Dependency CA (index 2,0)
        * Dependency CB (index 2,1)

A manifest-id of \[1,0\] would indicate that the current command was
contained within Dependency BA. Similarly, a manifest-id of \[2,1\]
would indicate Dependency CB

suit-record-manifest-section indicates which section of the manifest was
active. This is used in addition to an offset so that the developer can
index into severable sections in a predictable way. The value of this
element is the value of the key that identified the section in the
manifest.

suit-record-section-offset is the number of bytes into the current
section at which the current command is located.

suit-record-component-index is the index of the component that was
specified at the time that the report was generated. This field is
necessary due to the availability of set-current-component values of
True and a list of components. Both of these values cause the manifest
processor to loop over commands using a series of component-ids, so the
developer needs to know which was selected when the command executed.

suit-record-properties contains any measured properties that led to the
command failure.
For example, this could be the actual value of a SUIT\_Digest or
class identifier. This is encoded in a SUIT\_Parameters block as defined
in {{I-D.ietf-suit-manifest}}.

# The SUIT\_Report {#suit-report}

The SUIT\_Report is a SUIT-specific logging container. It contains
the SUIT\_Records needed to reconstruct the decisiosn made by a
Manifest Processor as well as references to the Manifest being 
processed, the result of processing, and an optional capability
report.

Some metadata is common to all records, such as the root manifest:
the manifest that is the entry-point for the manifest processor. This
metadata is aggregated with a list of SUIT\_Records. The SUIT\_Report
may also contain a list of any System Properties that were measured
and reported, and a reason for a failure if one occurred.

~~~CDDL
SUIT_Report = {
  suit-reference              => SUIT_Reference,
  ? suit-report-nonce         => bstr,
  suit-report-records         => \
        \[ * SUIT_Record / system-property-claims \],
  suit-report-result          => true / {
    suit-report-result-code   => int,
    suit-report-result-record => SUIT_Record,
    suit-report-result-reason => SUIT_Report_Reasons,
  },
  ? suit-report-capability-report => SUIT_Capability_Report,
  $$SUIT_Report_Extensions
}
system-property-claims = {
  system-component-id => SUIT_Component_Identifier,
  + SUIT_Parameters,
}
~~~

The suit-reference provides a reference URI and digest for a suit
manifest. The URI MUST be the canonical URI that is provided in the
manifest. The digest is the digest of the manifest.

NOTE: The digest is used
in preference to other identifiers in the manifest because it allows
a manifest to be uniquely identified (collision resistance) whereas
other identifiers, such as the sequence number, can collide,
particularly in scenarios with multiple trusted signers.

The following CDDL describes a SUIT\_Reference.

~~~CDDL
SUIT_Reference = {
    suit-report-manifest-uri  : tstr,
    suit-report-manifest-digest : SUIT_Digest,
}
~~~

suit-report-manifest-digest provides a SUIT\_Digest (as defined in
{{I-D.ietf-suit-manifest}}) that is the characteristic digest of the
Root manifest.

suit-report-manifest-uri provides the reference URI that was provided in
the root manifest.

suit-report-nonce provides a container for freshness or replay
protection information. This field MAY be omitted where the suit-report
is authenticated within a container that provides freshness already.
For example, attestation evidence typically contains a proof of
freshness.

## SUIT\_Report\_Records {#suit-report-records}

suit-report-records is a list of 0 or more SUIT\_Records or
system-property-claims. Because SUIT\_Records are only generated on failure,
in simple cases this can be an empty list. SUIT\_Records and
suit-system-property-claims are merged into a single list because this
reduces the overhead for a constrained node that generates this report.
The use of a single log allows report generators to use simple
memory management. Because the system-property-claims
are encoded as maps and SUIT\_Records are encoded as lists, a recipient need
only filter the CBOR Type-5 entries from suit-report-records to obtain all 
system-property-claims.

System Properties can be extracted from suit-report-records by filtering
suit-report-records for maps. System Properties are a list of measured
or asserted properties
of the system that creates the SUIT\_Report. These properties are scoped by
component identifier. Because this list is expected to be constructed on
the fly by a constrained node, component identifiers may appear more than
once. A recipient may convert the result to a more conventional structure:

~~~~CDDL
SUIT_Record_System_Properties = {
  * component-id => {
    + SUIT_Parameters,
  }
}
~~~~

## SUIT\_Report Result {#suit-report-result}

suit-report-result provides a mechanism to show that the SUIT procedure
completed successfully (value is true) or why it failed (value is a map
of an error code and a SUIT\_Record).

suit-report-result-reason gives a high-level explanation of the failure.
These reasons are intended for interoperable implementations. The reasons
are divided into a small number of groups:

* suit-report-reason-cbor-parse: a parsing error was encountered by the
CBOR parser.
* suit-report-reason-cose-unsupported: an unusupported COSE structure or
header was encountered.
* suit-report-reason-alg-unsupported: an unsupported COSE algorithm was
encountered.
* suit-report-reason-unauthorised: Signature/MAC verification failed.
* suit-report-reason-command-unsupported: an unsupported command was
encountered.
* suit-report-reason-component-unsupported: The manifest declared a
component/prefix that does not exist.
* suit-report-reason-component-unauthorised: The manifest declared a
component that is not accessible by the signer.
* suit-report-reason-parameter-unsupported: The manifest used a
parameter that does not exist.
* suit-report-severing-unsupported: The manifest uses severable fields
but the Manifest Processor doesn't support them.
* suit-report-reason-condition-failed: A condition failed with soft-
failure off.
* suit-report-reason-operation-failed: A command failed (e.g.,
download/copy/swap/write)

The suit-report-result-code reports an internal error code that is
provided for debugging reasons. This code is not intended for
interoperability.

The suit-report-result-record indicates the exact point in the manifest
or manifest dependency tree where the error occurred.

suit-report-capability-report provides a mechanism to report the capabilities of the Manifest Processor. The SUIT\_Capability\_Report is described in {{capabilities}}. The capability report is optional to include in the SUIT\_Report, according to an application-specific policy. While the SUIT\_Capability\_Report is not expected to be very large, applications should ensure that they only report capabilities when necessary in order to conserve bandwidth. A capability report is not necessary except when:

1. A client explicitly requests the capability report, or
2. A manifest attempts to use a capability that the Manifest Processor does not implement.

#  Attestation

Where Remote Attestation (see {{RFC9334}}, the RATS Architecture) is in use, the RATS Verifier (Verifier hereafter) requires a set of
Attestation Evidence. Attestation Evidence contains Evidence Claims about the Attester. These Evidence Claims
contain measurements about the Attester. Many of these measurements are the same measurements that are generated in SUIT,
which means that a SUIT\_Report contains most of the Claims and some of the Endorsements that a Verifier requires.

Using a SUIT\_Manifest and a SUIT\_Report, improves a well-informed Verifier's ability to appraise the trustworthiness of a remote device. Remote attestation is done by using the SUIT\_Manifest\_Envelope along with the SUIT\_Report to reconstruct the state of the device at boot time. By embedding data used for remote attestation in the SUIT\_Report, a remote device can use a verifiable data structure, such as an append-only log ({{I-D.ietf-scitt-architecture}}, Section 3) to notarize both measurements and debug/failure information via the same document. This document can then be conveyed to a Verifier as a part of the Attestation Evidence. A Remote Attestation format to convey Attestation Evidence, such as an Entity Attestation Token (EAT, see {{-EAT}}), that contains a SUIT\_Report MUST also include an integrity measurement of the Manifest Processor & Report Generator.

When a Concise Reference Integrity Manifest (CoRIM, see {{-CoRIM}}) is delivered in a SUIT\_Manifest\_Envelope, this codifies the delivery of appraisal information to the Verifier:

* The Firmware Distributor:
    * sends the SUIT\_Manifest\_Envelope to the Verifier without payload or text, but with CoRIM
    * sends the SUIT\_Manifest\_Envelope to the recipient without CoRIM, or text, but with payload
* The Recipient:
    * Installs the firmware as described in the SUIT\_Manifest and generates a SUIT\_report, which is encapsulated in an EAT by the installer and sent to the Firmware Distributor.
    * Boots the firmware as described in the SUIT\_Manifest and creates a SUIT\_report, which is encapsulated in an EAT by the installer and sent to the Firmware Distributor.
* The Firmware Distributor sends both reports to the Verifier (separately or together)
* The Verifier:
    * Reconstructs the state of the device using the manifest
    * Compares this state to the CoRIM
    * Returns an Attestation Report to the Firmware Distributor

This approach simplifies the design of the bootloader since it is able to use an append-only log. It allows a Verifier to validate this report against a signed CoRIM that is provided by the firmware author, which simplifies the delivery chain of verification information to the Verifier.

This information is not intended as Attestation Evidence and while an Attestation Report MAY provide this information for conveying error codes and/or failure reports, it SHOULD be translated into general-purpose claims for use by the Relying Party.

# Capability Reporting {#capabilities}

Because SUIT is extensible, a manifest author must know what capabilities a device has available. To enable this, a capability report is a set of lists that define which commands, parameters, algorithms, and component IDs are supported by a manifest processor.

The CDDL for a SUIT\_Capability\_Report follows:

~~~~CDDL
SUIT_Capability_Report = {
  suit-component-capabilities  => [+ SUIT_Component_Capability ]
  suit-command-capabilities          => [+ int],
  suit-parameters-capabilities       => [+ int],
  suit-crypt-algo-capabilities       => [+ int],
  ? suit-envelope-capabilities       => [+ int],
  ? suit-manifest-capabilities       => [+ int],
  ? suit-common-capabilities         => [+ int],
  ? suit-text-capabilities           => [+ int],
  ? suit-text-component-capabilities => [+ int],
  ? suit-dependency-capabilities     => [+ int],
  * [+int]                           => [+ int],
  $$SUIT_Capability_Report_Extensions
}

SUIT_Component_Capability = [*bstr,?true]
~~~

A SUIT\_Component\_Capability is similar to a SUIT\_Component\_ID, with one difference: it may optionally be terminated by a CBOR 'true' which acts as a wild-card match for any component with a prefix matching the SUIT\_Component\_Capability leading up to the 'true.' This feature is for use with filesystem storage, key value stores, or any other arbitrary-component-id storage systems.

When reporting capabilities, it is OPTIONAL to report capabilities that are declared mandatory by the SUIT Manifest {{I-D.ietf-suit-manifest}}. Capabilities defined by extensions MUST be reported.

Additional capability reporting can be added as follows: if a manifest element does not exist in this map, it can be added by specifying the CBOR path to the manifest element in an array and using this as the key. For example SUIT\_Dependencies, as described in {{I-D.ietf-suit-trust-domains}} could have an extension added, which was key 3 in the SUIT\_Dependencies map. This capability would be reported as: \[3, 3, 1\] => \[3\], where the key consists of the key for SUIT\_Manifest (3), the key for SUIT\_Common (3), and the key for SUIT\_Dependencies (1). Then the value indicates that this manifest processor supports the extension (3).

#  EAT Claim {#eat}

The SUIT\_Report is a form of measurement done by the SUIT Manifest Processor as it attempts to invoke a manifest or install a manifest. As a result, the SUIT\_Report can be captured in an EAT measurements type.
The Verifier MAY convert a SUIT\_Report into a more consumable version of the EAT claim by, for example, constructing a measurement results claim that contains the digest of a component, the vendor ID & class ID of a component, etc.

#  SUIT\_Report Container {#container}

The SUIT\_Report MUST be transported using one of the following methods:

- As part of a larger document that provides authenticity guarantees, such as within a `measurements` claim in an Entity Attestation Token (EAT {{-EAT}}).
- As the payload of a message transmitted over a communication security protocol, such as DTLS {{?RFC9147}}.
- Encapsulated within a secure container, such as a COSE structure. In the case of COSE, the container MUST be either a `COSE_Encrypt0` or `COSE_Sign1` structure. The SUIT_Report MUST be the sole payload, as illustrated by the CDDL fragment below.

~~~CDDL
SUIT_Report_Protected /= SUIT_Report_COSE_Sign1 \
                         .and SUIT_COSE_Profiles
SUIT_Report_Protected /= SUIT_Report_COSE_Sign1_Tagged \
                         .and SUIT_COSE_Profiles
SUIT_Report_Protected /= SUIT_Report_COSE_MAC0 \
                         .and SUIT_COSE_Profiles
SUIT_Report_Protected /= SUIT_Report_COSE_MAC0_Tagged \
                         .and SUIT_COSE_Profiles

SUIT_Report_COSE_Sign1_Tagged = #6.18(SUIT_Report_COSE_Sign1)
SUIT_Report_COSE_Sign1 = [
    protected : bstr,
    unprotected : {* int => any},
    payload : bstr .cbor SUIT_Report_Unprotected,
    signature : bstr
]
SUIT_Report_COSE_MAC0_Tagged = #6.17(SUIT_Report_COSE_MAC0)
SUIT_Report_COSE_MAC0 = [
    protected : bstr,
    unprotected : {* int => any},
    payload : bstr .cbor SUIT_Report_Unprotected,
    tag : bstr
]
SUIT_Report_Unprotected = SUIT_Report / SUIT_Report_COSE_Encrypt0
SUIT_Report_COSE_Encrypt0 = COSE_Encrypt0
~~~

Note that SUIT\_Report\_COSE\_Sign1 and SUIT\_Report\_COSE\_MAC0 MUST be combined with a SUIT\_COSE\_Profile from {{I-D.ietf-suit-mti}} using the CDDL .and directive. The SUIT\_Report\_COSE\_Encrypt0 carries a ciphertext payload that MUST contain just the ciphertext obtained by encrypting the following CDDL:

~~~CDDL
SUIT_Report_plaintext = bstr .cbor SUIT_Report
~~~

SUIT\_COSE\_Profiles, which use AES-CTR encryption, are not integrity protected and authenticated. For this purpose, SUIT\_Report\_Protected defines authenticated containers with an encrypted payload.

#  IANA Considerations {#iana}

IANA is requested to name the overall SUIT registry group "Software Update for the Internet of Things (SUIT)".

IANA is requested to allocate a CBOR tag for each of:

* SUIT\_Report\_Protected
* SUIT\_Reference
* SUIT\_Capability\_Report

IANA is requested to allocate a CoAP content-type {{?RFC7252}} and a media-type for SUIT\_Report.

IANA is also requested to add the following registries to the SUIT registry group:

* SUIT\_Report Elements
* SUIT\_Record Elements
* SUIT\_Report Reasons
* SUIT Capability Report Elements

For each of these registries, registration policy is:

* -256 to 255: Standards Action
* -65536 to 257, 256 to 65535: Specification Required
* -4294967296 to -65537, 65536 to 4294967295: First Come, First Served

## Expert Review Instructions
The IANA registries established in this document allow values to be added based on expert review. This section gives some general guidelines for what the experts should be looking for, but they are being designated as experts for a reason, so they should be given substantial latitude.

Expert reviewers should take into consideration the following points:

* Point squatting should be discouraged. Reviewers are encouraged to get sufficient information for registration requests to ensure that the usage is not going to duplicate one that is already registered, and that the point is likely to be used in deployments. The zones tagged as private use are intended for testing purposes and closed environments; code points in other ranges should not be assigned for testing.
* Specifications are required for the standards track range of point assignment. Specifications should exist for all other ranges, but early assignment before a specification is available is considered to be permissible. When specifications are not provided, the description provided needs to have sufficient information to identify what the point is being used for.
* Experts should take into account the expected usage of fields when approving point assignment. The fact that there is a range for standards track documents does not mean that a standards track document cannot have points assigned outside of that range. The length of the encoded value should be weighed against how many code points of that length are left, the size of device it will be used on, and the number of code points left that encode to that size.

#  Security Considerations {#seccons}

The SUIT\_Report serves four primary security objectives:

- Validated Identity
- Integrity
- Replay protection
- Confidentiality

The mechanisms for achieving these protections are outlined in {{container}}.

Ideally, a SUIT\_Report SHOULD be conveyed as part of a remote attestation procedure,
such as embeding it in EAT tokens that represent RATS conceptual messages. This approach ensures that the SUIT\_Report
is cryptographically bound to the environment (hardware, software, or both) in
which it was generated, thereby strengthening its authenticity.

A SUIT\_Report may disclose sensitive information about the device on which it
were produced. In such cases, the SUIT\_Report MUST be encrypted, as specified in
{{container}}.

Furthermore, failure reports, particularly those involving cryptographic operations,
can unintentionally reveal insights into system weaknesses or vulnerabilities. As such,
SUIT\_Reports SHOULD be encrypted whenever possible, to minimize the risk of information
leakage.

In addition to these core security requirements, operational considerations must be taken
into account. When a SUIT\_Report is included within another protocol message (e.g., inside
an encrypted EAT), care must be taken to avoid inadvertently leaking information and
to uphold the principle of least privilege. For example, in many EAT-based remote attestation flows,
the Verifier may not require the full SUIT\_Report. Similarly, the Relying Party might not
need access to it either.

To support least-privilege access, the SUIT\_Report should be independently encrypted, even
when the transport or enclosing token is also encrypted. This layered encryption ensures that
only authorized entities can access the contents of the SUIT\_Report.

In other scenarios, the EAT Verifier might require full access to a SUIT\_Report.
For example, the SUIT\_Report must be accessible in its entirety for the EAT Verifier
to extract or convert the SUIT\_Report content into specific EAT claims, such as `measres`
(Measurement Results). A typical case
involves translating a successful `suit-condition-image` check into a digest-based claim within
the EAT.

When applying cryptographic protection to the SUIT\_Report, the same algorithm profile used for
the corresponding SUIT manifest SHOULD be reused. The available algorithm profiles are detailed
in {{I-D.ietf-suit-mti}}. If using the same profile is not feasible (e.g., due to constraints
imposed by `suit-sha256-hsslms-a256kw-a256ctr`), then a profile offering comparable security
strength SHOULD be selected—for instance, `suit-sha256-esp256-ecdh-a128ctr`.
